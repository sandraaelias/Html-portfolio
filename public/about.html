    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a self-taught programmer with a big passion for understanding how
      websites are built. I've always been curious about what happens behind the
      scenes of the web , and that curiosity led me to start learning
      programming on my own. I'm currently building my skills step by step, and
      my goal is to start working either as a freelancer or as apart of a
      company. I believe in learning by doing and I'm excited for the joueney
      ahead !
